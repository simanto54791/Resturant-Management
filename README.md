# Resturant-Management
My Project is a “RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.”

A Restaurant Management System (RMS) solves real-life challenges by streamlining operations such as order processing, inventory tracking, employee scheduling, and menu management. It reduces order errors, delays, and stock shortages by automating tasks and ensuring real-time updates. Efficient staff management helps prevent scheduling conflicts, while digital payments and customer data tracking improve service quality. By minimizing waste, optimizing resources, and enhancing customer experience, an RMS helps restaurants run smoothly, increase profitability, and adapt to dynamic business demands.
